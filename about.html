      <p id="profileDesc">Hey there! I'm Alisa, the "author" of this website! I'm a current high school sophomore, and I'm a big advocate for all things online safety and digital well-being, especially when it comes to involving youth in the discussion. Alongside this project, I've also worked directly with Roblox on their Teen Civility Council to push for similar initiatives, and my passion for this cause has grown ever since!</p>
      <p id="profileDesc">Outside of building websites, I also enjoy 3D modeling, crocheting, reading, and journaling -- basically any art form you can think of. This project has truly been the perfect mix of problem-solving and creativity, so I look forward to creating more. :)</p>
